## About

This project was created for UC Irvine's [HackUCI](https://www.hackuci.com/) 2020 hackathon. It started as a solo project created in 32 hours. For more detailed information on the project, please refer to the Devpost link above.

## Technologies

* Python
* OpenCV
* Keras
* scikit-learn
* Flask
* Twilio API

## Future Improvements

* Improve basic CNN architecture (and migrate to TF 2.0 Keras).
* Synthetically add more data with Tensorflow's data augmentation libraries.

## Acknowledgements

The data folder was downloaded from an article on [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/29/detecting-parkinsons-disease-with-opencv-computer-vision-and-the-spiral-wave-test/) which provides the author's own approach to machine learning on this data set. Some of the computer vision techniques were derived from his post. Additionally, he mentioned the source of the data set, Adriano de Oliveira Andrade and Joao Paulo Folado from the NIATS of Federal University of UberlaÌ‚ndia.
